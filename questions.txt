How to set a title for pages other than predefined "@title" (which is
constructed in a strange, undocumented way)?

  use @site_title to access the "title" defined in root level config.yml
  with the combination of @page.metadata('pagetitle') or any other key
  you fancy

  ! note 
  Generally, any kind of global variables list, and how are they
conctructed and how they could be overriden would be really helpful
(@title, for example. on my install it was contructed from the h1 of the
page "dash" and the h1 of the "index" page in the same level).
