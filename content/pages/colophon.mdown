# About this web site

This website is built with [Nesta CMS](http://nestacms.com/), which is a tiny Ruby publishing system built on top of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). Typography is enhanced by [Typogruby](http://avdgaag.github.com/typogruby/).

On the client side this website is built with [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/) for layouts, [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for contents and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for styling. All this is processed to become <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5 and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>3. 

All the code is handwritten in [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). You can find the source for this website on [github](https://github.com/gryzzly/mishareyzlin.com) – you can use whatever code you find there for whatever purpose.

Typefaces are excellent [PT Sans and PT Serif](http://www.paratype.com/public/) by [ParaType Inc.](http://www.paratype.com/). They are served through [Google’s Web Fonts API](http://www.google.com/webfonts).
