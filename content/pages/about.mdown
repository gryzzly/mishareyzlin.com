# About me

I am <span class="years-age">22 years</span> old geek, currently in Berlin. Historically, I come from [Siberia](http://goo.gl/maps/88n9) (yes, it is very cold there).

Mainly, I code <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript. I am also interested in typography, UI and graphic design very much.
