# Realized

- Order items in the collections by drag and drop

- Make proper request to Netlify API to show build status

# Ideas

- Allow collections sorting to be selected (by which field, or manual)

- Build twitter-like editing interace: big textarea at the top to add a page,
or select to which collection to add.

# Discarded ideas

- Try Pell for editor? – Too primitive API, a lot of manual work to implement,
admin can load a bit more script
